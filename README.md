## Work & Research Experience
**Senior Data Science Consultant @ EY - Strategy & Transaction (_April 2023 - Present_)**
- Led the opportunity sizing for the NHS One Digital Citizen and Shared Care Records pathway used to feed into the business cases to allocate £3.5M for transforming social care with technology. 
- Independently reviewed the sales forecast model of a $7B pharmaceutical portfolio’s sales using ETS in R, improving accuracy and authoring a detailed report.
- Developed a multi-criteria decision analysis framework and opportunity sizing model for NHS Digital Channels for the NHS App opportunity sizing, integrating various weighted factors.
- Engineered a SQL-based data processing pipeline for Royal Papworth Hospital, automating patient identification and saving 10+ hours weekly; conducted a Qlik Sense workshop within 48 hours.
- Independent algorithm reviews of start-ups and biotechnology companies and conducted the commercial opportunity of their application and use in order to generate revenue.

**Honorary Research Fellow @ UCL - Department of Surgical Biotechnology (_January 2023 - Present_)**
- I lead all the data analyses for all studies, notable example was utilising NLP for sentiment analysis on post-botulinum toxin injection survey; our publications have reached the news multiple times regarding the regulation and safety of non-surgical aesthetics (Botox, fillers) in the UK. 
- Contributed to the first MedEd platform in the metaverse for non-surgical aesthetic education.
- Created StepUp, a collaborative research platform for medical students and junior doctors, winning two prizes and £250 in AWS credits at the Royal Free x PLASTA Hackathon 2022.
- Supervising multiple medical students in our research group across different research projects.
- Supervised by (Professor Afshin Mosahebi)[https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/6101-afshin-mosahebi/about]

**Data Science Consultant @ EY (_September 2021 - March 2023_)**
- Independently validated a £206 billion Markov chain model using advanced statistical techniques in R.
- Created a dynamic web scraping and automated reporting tool for NHS England, reducing report generation time to under 10 minutes, used for bids and client conversations; requested to be bought. 
- Implemented a Python-based ETL pipeline for Qualtrics and proforma data, enabling real-time updates and reducing manual handling, reducing manual data handing by 80%. 
- Worked with a health information exchange (HIE) in the MENA region and the commercial data opportunity of the population’s healthcare data environment; initiated a new revenue stream by linking population health metrics with dental data.

**Honorary Research Fellow @ KCL - King's Health Partner's (_June 2021 - Present_)**
- Principle bioinformatician of the CEDiD study - prediction of COVID-19 infection using data form wearable smartwatches prior to symptom on-set
-	Using bash to pre-process the data and R for the analysis of 30 participants wearable data over 30 days, including heart rate, basal temperature, blood volume pulse, and accelerometer data sampled at 32Hz each.
-	Supervised by (Professor Anne Greenough)[https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/professor-anne-greenough]

**App Developer @ Virtuoso (_June 2021 - December 2021_)**
- Worked on the prototype of the mobile application of Virtuoso, a MedEd / EdTech start up using Flutter, for deployment in iOS and Android mobile phones. Exited, as the founding team wanted to take another direction. 
- Virtuoso entered demo day, an annual event where London’s leading universities (Imperial, UCL and KCL) come together to showcase the best and brightest start-ups. Virtuoso is powered by King’s Accelerator.

**Researcher @ Imperial College London - Institute of Reproductive Developmental Biology (_Sept 2020 - Sept 2021_)**
- Developed a machine learning model using LASSO regression to predict the progression of high-grade serous ovarian cancer patients, leveraging RNA-Seq gene expression data and MYLK3 gene beta methylation values. Conducted model development and analyses in R.
- Supervised by [Professor Sadaf Ghaem-Maghami](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/s.ghaem-maghami/publications)

**Postgraduate Researcher @ Imperial College London - Institute of Reproductive Developmental Biology (_Sept 2019 - Sept 2020_)**
- Investigated the effect of alcohol consumption, BMI, and smoking on the prognosis of serous ovarian cancer patients; further build a logistic regression machine learning model predicting the exposure levels using methylation (Illumina 450k) and gene expression data in R.
